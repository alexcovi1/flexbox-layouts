# Flexbox Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn and practice the fundamentals of **CSS Flexbox**. Flexbox is a powerful layout system that allows you to create responsive and flexible layouts with ease.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore how to use Flexbox to arrange elements on the page, control alignment, distribute space, and make layouts responsive. The goal is to practice using different **Flexbox properties** such as `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-wrap`, and more.

### Key Concepts Covered:
1. **Flex Containers and Flex Items**
2. **flex-direction**: Row vs. Column layouts
3. **justify-content**: Horizontal alignment of items
4. **align-items & align-self**: Vertical alignment of items
5. **flex-wrap**: Wrapping items onto multiple lines
6. **gap**: Controlling spacing between flex items
